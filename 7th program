Kumar wants to learn how the calculators are working.so he is trying to implements the calculator program.could you please help him to implements the program. - Notes:- Must use the Switch Case.operators - Addition - Subtraction - Multiplication - Division - Modulo

Input Format

First input consists of integer.
Second input consists of integer.
third input consists of character.
Constraints

No Constraints

Output Format

print the calculation Value.
if the symbol is not the arithmetic operator,print the statement is "Invalid Input".
Sample Input 0

4
+
Sample Output 0

Addition of two number is 7.0
Sample Input 1

7

2
/
Sample Output 2

Division of two number is 6.5

#code

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
a = int(input().strip())
b = int(input().strip())
op = input().strip()

match op:
    case '+':
        print(f"Addition of two number is {float(a + b)}")
    case '-':
        print(f"Subtraction of two number is {float(a - b)}")
    case '*':
        print(f"Multiplication of two number is {float(a * b)}")
    case '/':
        if b != 0:
            print(f"Division of two number is {a / b}")
        else:
            print("Division by zero is not allowed.")
    case '%':
        if b != 0:
            print(f"Modulo of two number is {float(a % b)}")
        else:
            print("Modulo by zero is not allowed.")
    case _:
        print("Invalid Input")
